A rest API that I made. It's made to mimic a very simple social media-ish feel. It manages users, and their posts. The users have a unique ID, username, and a date of birth. The posts have a post id, description, and date of posting.
The API communicates with either H2 or MySQL, whichever you prefer, you can find the MySQL commands in the .txt file included in the main folder. In order to change the db provider, you must change the pom.xml and application.properties files.
Everything should work correctly, as it was tested, but if you find anything wrong, make sure to let me know.
