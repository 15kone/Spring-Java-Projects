This is a simple to-do app made with Spring. It uses Spring Security authentication, an H2 Database, JPA to communicate with it, and Spring MVC to actually show the
webpages. My first take at a web-app, I tested everything, and it should all work, but if you find anything off with it, make sure to let me know.
The pages are styled using bootstrap.
